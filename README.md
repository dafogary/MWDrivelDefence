```

This will display the text with a "Check Plain English" button that users can click to analyze the text.

## Accessibility Analysis Features

### Reading Level Analysis
The extension calculates multiple readability metrics:
- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**: Estimates the U.S. school grade level needed to understand the text
- **Flesch Reading Ease**: Scores text on a 0-100 scale (higher scores = easier to read)
- **Gunning Fog Index**: Estimates years of formal education needed to understand the text

**Target Scores for Accessibility**:
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 8 or below
- Flesch Reading Ease: 60 or above  
- Gunning Fog Index: 12 or below

### Dyslexia-Friendly Analysis
Checks content against dyslexia-friendly design principles:
- **Paragraph Length**: Identifies paragraphs over 40 words
- **Sentence Complexity**: Flags sentences over 20 words or with high syllable density
- **Complex Words**: Lists words with 4+ syllables
- **Recommendations**: Provides specific suggestions for improvement

### Screen Reader Compatibility
Analyzes HTML structure for screen reader accessibility:
- **Images**: Checks for missing alt text
- **Headings**: Validates proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- **Forms**: Ensures form inputs have labels or aria-labels
- **Tables**: Verifies data tables have header cells

### Color Contrast Analysis
Built-in tool for testing color combinations:
- **WCAG AA Compliance**: 4.5:1 ratio for normal text
- **WCAG AAA Compliance**: 7:1 ratio for enhanced accessibility
- **Large Text**: 3:1 ratio for 18pt+ or 14pt+ bold text
- **Interactive Calculator**: Test any color combination instantly

## Testing the Accessibility Features

A test page is included (`accessibility-test.html`) that demonstrates all the new accessibility analysis features. Open this file in a web browser to:
- Test reading level analysis with sample text
- Use the color contrast checker
- See how the WCAG compliance scoring works
- Understand the dyslexia-friendly recommendations

### API Integration

The extension integrates with MediaWiki's resource loader system and provides:
- Responsive design that works on mobile devices
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliant interface design
- Integration with MediaWiki's notification system
- Proper internationalization support

## Configuration

The extension works out of the box with no additional configuration required. However, you can customize:

### Basic Settings
- **Permissions**: Control who can access the special page by modifying user rights
- **Interface Messages**: Customize messages by editing the i18n files
- **Styling**: Override CSS styles to match your wiki's theme

### Automatic Analysis Settings
Add these to your `LocalSettings.php` to enable automatic talk page analysis:

```php
# Enable automatic analysis when pages are saved
$wgMWDrivelDefenceAutoAnalyze = true;

# Namespaces to analyze (0=Main, 4=Project, etc.)
$wgMWDrivelDefenceNamespaces = [ 0, 4 ];

# Minimum word count to trigger analysis
$wgMWDrivelDefenceMinWords = 50;

# Maximum recommended sentence length
$wgMWDrivelDefenceMaxSentenceLength = 25;
```

## Advanced Usage

### Template Integration
Create a template for common usage:
```wiki
<includeonly>{{#drivelcheck:{{{1}}}}}</includeonly>
```

Then use: `{{PlainEnglishCheck|Text to check}}`

### Automatic Talk Page Analysis
When enabled, the extension automatically analyzes pages when they are saved and posts results to the talk page if issues are found:

- **Triggered by**: Page saves in configured namespaces
- **Minimum threshold**: Only analyzes pages with sufficient content (configurable)
- **Talk page topics**: Creates new sections with analysis results
- **Summary includes**: Word counts, sentence analysis, and specific recommendations
- **Non-intrusive**: Only posts when actual issues are detected

Example talk page entry:
```
== Plain English Analysis ==

This page was automatically analyzed for plain English compliance on July 1, 2025.

'''Summary:'''
* Total words: 342
* Total sentences: 18
* Average words per sentence: 19.0
* Sentences over 25 words: 3
* Words with simpler alternatives: 7

'''Recommendations:'''

âš  Found 7 words that could be replaced with simpler alternatives.
```

### Batch Analysis Script
For more control over when analysis occurs, use the included batch analysis script. This is particularly useful for:
- Analyzing multiple pages at once
- Running analysis on a schedule via cron jobs
- Processing recently edited content
- Avoiding real-time performance impact on page saves

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Navigate to your MediaWiki directory
cd /var/www/html/your-wiki

# Analyze a specific page
php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --page="Page_name"

# Test what would be analyzed without making changes
php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --page="Page_name" --dry-run
```

#### Analyze Recent Content
```bash
# Analyze pages modified in the last 24 hours
php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=1

# Analyze pages modified in the last week (7 days)
php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=7

# Analyze pages modified in the last month (30 days)
php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=30
```

#### Limit Analysis Scope
```bash
# Limit to 20 pages maximum
php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=7 --limit=20

# Analyze only main namespace (0) pages
php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=1 --namespace=0

# Combine options: recent pages in main namespace with limit
php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=1 --namespace=0 --limit=10
```

#### Advanced Options
```bash
# Force re-analysis of pages already analyzed
php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=7 --force

# Preview what would be analyzed (dry run)
php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=7 --limit=50 --dry-run
```

#### Automated Analysis with Cron Jobs
Set up automated analysis to run regularly without manual intervention:

**Daily Analysis (recommended)**
```bash
# Edit your crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line to analyze recent pages daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /var/www/html/your-wiki && php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=1 --limit=20 >/dev/null 2>&1
```

**Weekly Analysis**
```bash
# Run every Sunday at 3 AM to catch any missed pages
0 3 * * 0 cd /var/www/html/your-wiki && php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=7 --limit=50 >/dev/null 2>&1
```

**Monthly Comprehensive Analysis**
```bash
# Run on the 1st of each month at 4 AM
0 4 1 * * cd /var/www/html/your-wiki && php extensions/MWDrivelDefence/analyzePagesForPlainEnglish.php --recent=30 --limit=100 --force >/dev/null 2>&1
```

#### Script Features
- **Smart Duplicate Prevention**: Avoids re-analyzing pages that were analyzed in the last 30 days (unless `--force` is used)
- **Issue-Based Filtering**: Only posts to talk pages when actual issues are found (long sentences, complex words)
- **Namespace Respect**: Only analyzes namespaces configured in `$wgMWDrivelDefenceNamespaces`
- **Performance Optimization**: Includes delays between pages to prevent server overload
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides comprehensive summaries of analysis results

#### Example Outputs
```
